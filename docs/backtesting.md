## 🚀 Quick start

> 💡 Tip: See strategy examples at /crates/a_strategies/examples

- Minimal programmatic start (pseudocode using helpers already in the repo):
  - Create a DB pool (Postgres), ensure schema
  - Build BacktestConfig (step, date range)
  - Start backtest with your Strategy via start_backtest(db, cfg, strategy)

Relevant entry points in the codebase:
- crates/engine/src/backtest/orchestrator.rs (start_backtest, BacktestConfig)
- crates/engine/src/backtest/backtest_feeder.rs (BacktestFeederConfig and engine)
- crates/engine/bin/backtest_orders.rs (end-to-end demo exercising order types)


## ⏱️ Orchestrator and time

Backtests are driven by a deterministic, logical clock advanced by the orchestrator.

- BacktestConfig
  - step: chrono::Duration – advance logical time by this step; feeder emits data <= now each step.
  - feeder: BacktestFeederConfig – parameters for historical fetch and realism models.
  - start_date, end_date (optional): map to feeder.range_start/range_end (UTC) for clamping.
  - clock: optional shared BacktestClock (advanced deterministically alongside emissions).

> 🔒 Determinism
> - All scheduling (ack, first-fill, cancel/replace effects) is relative to the logical watermark set by BacktestAdvanceTo.
> - There are no Utc::now() fallbacks in the backtest path; timestamps come from the orchestrator or data.


## 📦 Historical feeder (BacktestFeederConfig)

Controls windowing and realism model factories. Defaults are sensible for CME-style futures.
- window: prefetch window size (e.g., 2 days) used to bulk load data chunks per key.
- lookahead: additional prefetch beyond the window to reduce refills.
- warmup: optional period prior to range_start to emit for consolidator warmup.
- range_start/range_end: optional UTC clamps for the backtest.
- make_latency: Fn() -> Box<dyn LatencyModel>
- make_fill: Fn() -> Box<dyn FillModel>
- make_slippage: Fn() -> Box<dyn SlippageModel>
- make_fee: Fn() -> Box<dyn FeeModel>
- calendar: Arc<dyn SessionCalendar>

The feeder:
- Caches latest marks (tick/quote/candle) per symbol and latest MBP10 book snapshot.
- Emits data in timestamp order up to the orchestrator’s watermark.
- Simulates order lifecycles using the configured models and emits OrdersBatch updates.
- Emits position/account snapshots on fills; the runtime also synthesizes periodic snapshots (<= 1 Hz) only when content changes.


## 🧪 Realism models (defaults and behavior)

Quick look:

| Model | Default | What it does | Key knobs |
|---|---|---|---|
| LatencyModel | PxLatency | Models submit/ack/fill/cxl/replace timing | submit_to_ack, ack_to_first_fill, cancel_rtt, replace_rtt |
| FillModel | CmeFillModel + FillConfig | Matches orders vs. last price + MBP10 | Market policy, Limit policy, price-limit guard |
| SlippageModel | NoSlippage | Adjusts execution price | Customizable for spread/impact |
| FeeModel | PxFlatFee | Applies per-fill fees/rebates | Per-account accumulation |
| SessionCalendar | HoursCalendar | Open/halting/limit-lock gating | is_open, next_open_after, is_limit_locked |

Details:

LatencyModel (default: PxLatency)
- submit_to_ack(): delay from submission to acknowledgment.
- ack_to_first_fill(): delay from ack to first possible fill.
- cancel_rtt()/replace_rtt(): round-trip time for cancel/replace effects. Orders remain fillable until the effect time.

FillModel (default: CmeFillModel with FillConfig)
- Uses simulated time and an optional BookLevels snapshot for matching.
- Supports market policies: BookWalk, AtTouch, AtMid.
- Supports limit policies: TouchOrCross, AtOrBetter, NextTickOnly.
- Stop and StopLimit logic triggers off last price and/or book; trailing stop ratchets; buy-side bug fixed.
- Price-limit guard: no fills if SessionCalendar::is_limit_locked at candidate prices.
- Maker attribution: if an order previously rested (0 fills), the next fills are tagged maker=true.
- Partial fills: produces multiple fills over time; leaves keep working until done or canceled.

SlippageModel (default: NoSlippage)
- No price adjustment. You can swap in custom models later (e.g., spread-aware, gap-on-trigger).

FeeModel (default: PxFlatFee)
- Returns negative Money amounts for fees (positive for rebates if implemented). Applied per fill.
- Per-account fee snapshots are accumulated and emitted.

SessionCalendar (default: HoursCalendar)
- is_open/is_halt gates fills; next_open_after defers work when closed; optional limit-lock checks.


## 🔄 Order lifecycle semantics

- Submit → Ack: scheduled by submit_to_ack().
- Ack → First fill: scheduled by ack_to_first_fill().
- Matching uses current MBP10 book (if present) and last mark to price.
- Partials: if book depth can’t satisfy full qty, partial fills emit OrderState::PartiallyFilled and the remainder keeps working.
- Cancel/Replace: effects occur at cancel_rtt()/replace_rtt() after request; orders remain live and fillable until the effect timestamp.
- No forced fills: if matching produces zero fills, the order remains working (resting) and is retried on subsequent ticks.


## 📊 Snapshots and portfolio

- Positions: maintained per-account/instrument; PositionsBatch emitted on fill ticks (and periodically by runtime when content changes, throttled to ≤ 1/s).
- Accounts: AccountDeltaBatch snapshots reflect fee cash flows and timing; realized PnL from trades is computed by the portfolio from executions/positions and last prices.


## ▶️ Running the demo

> ✅ Prereqs: Ensure Postgres is available and the schema is initialized (ensure_schema is called in the demo).

See: [see strategy examples](/crates/a_strategies/examples)

## ⚙️ Configuration tips

- ⏱️ Step size: choose a step consistent with your data frequency (e.g., 250 ms–1 s for 1s/1m bars).
- 🧭 Policies: adjust FillConfig to switch market/limit policies.
- 💸 Fees/Slippage: plug different model factories via BacktestFeederConfig to run scenario analyses.
- 🗓️ Calendar: use your venue’s session calendar for correct open/halting and price limits.


## ⚠️ Known modeling limitations (v1)

> 🟠 These are known and on the roadmap; contributions welcome.

- No queue priority modeling at touch; no order book queue position.
- Default slippage is none; consider custom models for gap/impact.
- TIF (IOC/FOK) and bracket orders are not yet simulated end-to-end.
